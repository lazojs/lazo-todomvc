# Lazojs TodoMVC Example

[Lazo](https://github.com/lazojs/lazo) is a full stack client-server web framework based on Backbone,
Requirejs, and Handlebars (default template engine; you can use whatever template engine you like :)).

The name is derived from the Spanish word LAZO which means link. 

The goal of Lazo is to provide a ‘link’ between the client and server for application views, models, and business
logic allowing developer to create complex applications with ease.

* Lazo gives the front-end engineer 100% control over the UI layer.
* Lazo is 100% SEO compliant.
* Lazo has an optmized time to render.
* Lazo is being used to power the internal business tools [@WalmartLabs](http://www.walmartlabs.com).

## !important If You Read Anything Read this Section

> The majority of this code is based on other Backbone TodoMVC examples. Please refer to those examples
for further documentation.

Please note that these examples are written within the context of TodoMVC and certain aspects of the implementations
would not be the same outside of this context. For example, when filtering the todo list one would likely send back
up the filtered subset of data as opposed to the entire result set. The latter approach was taken so that these examples
would be easier to compare to other library and framework examples.

### Four different implementations are included:

* **components/todos-single:** This is TodoMVC in its most basic form. It is one component that renders the entire screen.
* **components/todos-child-views:** This example uses one component that render the entire screen, but the header and footer
    sections are rendered by child views.
* **components/todos-multiple:** This example illustrates how to break up a page into reusable components. It consists
  of a parent component, `components/todos-multiple`, and three child components - `components/header`, `components/main`,
  `components/footer`.
* **components/todos-layout:** This example further expands upon the reusable components concept and intrdocues a new
  concept, layouts. A layout is a component that contains a component container with the reserved value "lazo-layout-body". The
  layout component is associated to route as a property in addition to the component property (see `app/app.json`).
  The component associated with the route in question is rendered in the "lazo-layout-body" component container. If an executed
  route handler references the last layout rendered then only the "lazo-layout-body" component is rendered
  on the client. An application can also specify a default layout outside of the route definitions.

## Getting started

```shell
git clone https://github.com/{YOUR_USERNAME}/lazo-todomvc.git
```

Install dependencies (from local lazo-todomvc repo):

```shell
npm install
```

Finally start the new application (from local lazo-todomvc repo):
